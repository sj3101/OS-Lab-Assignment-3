# OS Lab Assignment 3 – Scheduling, File Allocation & Memory Management Simulation

## Description
Python-based simulation of CPU scheduling algorithms, file allocation strategies, and memory management techniques as per ENCS351 Operating Systems Lab requirements.
This assignment demonstrates Priority & Round Robin scheduling, Sequential & Indexed file allocation, and First-Fit, Best-Fit, Worst-Fit, MFT, and MVT memory allocation strategies.

## Features Implemented
- ✅ Task 1: Priority & Round Robin CPU Scheduling Simulation
- ✅ Task 2: Sequential File Allocation Strategy
- ✅ Task 3: Indexed File Allocation Strategy
- ✅ Task 4: Contiguous Memory Allocation (First-Fit, Best-Fit, Worst-Fit)
- ✅ Task 5: MFT (Fixed Partitions) & MVT (Variable Partitions) Memory Management

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Windows / Linux / macOS
- Basic terminal/command-line support
- No external packages required (only built-in Python modules)

## Installation & Usage
```bash
# Clone the repository (if applicable)
git clone <your-repo-url>

# Run individual programs
python3 scheduling.py
